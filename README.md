# SUMO Traffic Simulation Workshop

This repository contains the materials used in the SUMO traffic simulation workshop, conducted at the University of Moratuwa, Department of Transport Management and Logistics Engineering. The workshop was held in parallel with the MERCon conference.

## Workshop Overview

The workshop focused on using the SUMO open-source simulator to develop realistic traffic simulation models. Participants gained hands-on experience in:

- Setting up and configuring SUMO
- Developing and running traffic simulation models
- Generating simulation outputs

## Contents

- **Slides:** Presentation materials used during the workshop.
- **Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides for each of the exercises.

## Acknowledgments

This workshop and the research behind it were conducted as part of IRG-42, "Guidelines for implementing bus priority measures in Asian Cities: A simulation-based approach." We gratefully acknowledge the funding and support provided by IRG-42. For more information, please visit their [website](https://easts.info/irg/).
